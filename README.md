# LibreELEC USB/SD Creator

This is a lightweight image writing app with a simple four-step GUI for creating LibreELEC USB/SD Card installation media on Linux, macOS and Windows. It automatically displays the currently available downloads (defaulting to the latest release) and detects OS locale to switch the GUI to a matching local language.

**Translation Changes**

Changes to master language (en_GB) strings can be submitted via pull request to this GitHub repo. English strings are periodically synchronised to a Transifex project: https://www.transifex.com/libreelec/libreelec-usb-sd-creator allowing contributors to translate them into other languages. Translated strings are periodically synchronised from Transifex back to this repo for inclusion in the next release.

Pull requests for all other languages will be rejected. You will be asked to submit changes via Transifex.

**Translation Languages**

Requests for new languages should be made on Transifex. Once a new language has been approved it will be added to the translation project where you can conribute translated strings.

Please note: languages are translated by people (you) not magic!

**Issues and Support**
